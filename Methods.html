            <h2> 4
            Methods and Testing</h2>
            So far, we’ve written programs that have only one method, named main. In
            this chapter, we’ll show you how to organize programs into multiple methods.
            We’ll also take a look at the Math class, which provides methods for common
            mathematical operations. Finally, we’ll discuss strategies for incrementally
            developing and testing your code.<br><br>
            4.1 Defining New Methods
            Some methods perform a computation and return a result. For example,
            nextDouble reads input from the keyboard and returns it as a double. Other
            methods, like println, carry out a sequence of actions without returning a
            result. Java uses the keyword void to define such methods:
            public static void newLine() {
            System.out.println();
            }
            public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("First line.");
            newLine();
            System.out.println("Second line.");<br><br>
            
            <h3>Chapter 4 Methods and Testing<h3></h3><br>
            In this example, the newLine and main methods are both public, which means
            they can be invoked (or “called”) from other classes. And they are both void,
            which means that they don’t return a result (in contrast to nextDouble). The
            output of the program is shown here:
            First line.
            Second line.
            Notice the extra space between the lines. If we wanted more space between
            them, we could invoke the same method repeatedly. Or we could write yet
            another method (named threeLine) that displays three blank lines:
            public class NewLine {
            public static void newLine() {
            System.out.println();
            }
            public static void threeLine() {
            newLine();
            newLine();
            newLine();
            }
            public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("First line.");
            threeLine();
            System.out.println("Second line.");
            }
            }
            In this example, the name of the class is NewLine. By convention, class
            names begin with a capital letter. NewLine contains three methods, newLine,
            threeLine, and main. Remember that Java is case-sensitive, so NewLine and
            newLine are not the same.
            By convention, method names begin with a lowercase letter and use “camel
            case”, which is a cute name for jammingWordsTogetherLikeThis. You can
            use any name you want for methods, except main or any of the Java keywords.<br><br>
            
           <h4> 4.2 Flow of Execution</h4><br>
            When you look at a class definition that contains several methods, it is tempt-
            ing to read it from top to bottom. But that is not the flow of execution, or
            the order the program actually runs. The NewLine program runs methods in
            the opposite order than they are listed.
            Programs always begin at the first statement of main, regardless of where it is
            in the source file. Statements are executed one at a time, in order, until you
            reach a method invocation, which you can think of as a detour. Instead of
            going to the next statement, you jump to the first line of the invoked method,
            execute all the statements there, and then come back and pick up exactly
            where you left off.
            That sounds simple enough, but remember that one method can invoke another
            one. In the middle of main, the previous example goes off to execute the
            statements in threeLine. While in threeLine, it goes off to execute newLine.
            Then newLine invokes println, which causes yet another detour.
            Fortunately, Java is good at keeping track of which methods are running.
            So when println completes, it picks up where it left off in newLine; when
            newLine completes, it goes back to threeLine; and when threeLine com-
            pletes, it gets back to main.
            Beginners often wonder why it’s worth the trouble to write other methods,
            when they could just do everything in main. The NewLine example demon-
            strates a few reasons:
             Creating a new method allows you to name a block of statements, which
            makes the code easier to read and understand.
             Introducing new methods can make the program shorter by eliminating
            repetitive code. For example, to display nine consecutive newlines, you
            could invoke threeLine three times.
             A common problem-solving technique is to break problems down into sub-
            problems. Methods allow you to focus on each subproblem in isolation,
            and then compose them into a complete solution.
            Perhaps most importantly, organizing your code into multiple methods allows
            you to test individual parts of your program separately. It’s easier to get a
            complex program working if you know that each method works correctly.<br><br>
            
           <h4>4.3 Parameters and Arguments</h4><br>
            Some of the methods we have used require arguments, which are the values
            you provide in parentheses when you invoke the method.
            For example, the println method takes a String argument. To display a
            message, you have to provide the message: System.out.println("Hello").
            Similarly, the printf method can take multiple arguments. The statement
            System.out.printf("%d in = %f cm\n", inch, cm) has three arguments:
            the format string, the inch value, and the cm value.
            When you invoke a method, you provide the arguments. When you define a
            method, you name the parameters, which are variables that indicate what
            arguments are required. The following class shows an example:
            public class PrintTwice {
            public static void printTwice(String s) {
            System.out.println(s);
            System.out.println(s);
            }
            public static void main(String[] args) {
            printTwice("Don't make me say this twice!");
            }
            }
            The printTwice method has a parameter named s with type String. When
            you invoke printTwice, you have to provide an argument with type String.
            Before the method executes, the argument gets assigned to the parameter. In
            the printTwice example, the argument "Don't make me say this twice!"
            gets assigned to the parameter s.
            This process is called parameter passing, because the value gets passed from
            outside the method to the inside. An argument can be any kind of expression,
            so if you have a String variable, you can use its value as an argument:
            String message = "Never say never.";
            printTwice(message);<br><br>
            <h4>4.4 Multiple Parameters<h/4><br><br>
            The value you provide as an argument must have the same (or compatible)
            type as the parameter. For example, if you try this:
            printTwice(17); // syntax error
            You will get an error message like this:
            File: Test.java [line: 10]
            Error: method printTwice in class Test cannot be applied
            to given types;
            required: java.lang.String
            found: int
            reason: actual argument int cannot be converted to
            java.lang.String by method invocation conversion
            This error message says that it found an int argument, but the required
            parameter should be a String. In the case of printTwice, Java won’t convert
            the integer 17 to the string "17" automatically.
            Sometimes Java can convert an argument from one type to another auto-
            matically. For example, Math.sqrt requires a double, but if you invoke
            Math.sqrt(25), the integer value 25 is automatically converted to the floating-
            point value 25.0.
            Parameters and other variables exist only inside their own methods. In the
            printTwice example, there is no such thing as s in the main method. If you
            try to use it there, you’ll get a compiler error.
            Similarly, inside printTwice there is no such thing as message. That variable
            belongs to main. Because variables exist only inside the methods where they
            are defined, they are often called local variables.
