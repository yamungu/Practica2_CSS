            <h2>Chapter 3
            Input and Output</h2><br><br>
            The programs you’ve looked at so far simply display messages, which doesn’t
            really involve that much computation. This chapter shows you how to read
            input from the keyboard, use that input to calculate a result, and then format
            that result for output.<br>
            3.1 The System Class
            We have been using System.out.println for a while, but you might not
            have thought about what it means. System is a class that provides methods
            related to the “system”, or environment, where programs run. It also pro-
            vides System.out, which is a special value that has additional methods (like
            println) for displaying output.
            In fact, we can use System.out.println to display the value of System.out:
            System.out.println(System.out);
            The result is shown here:
            java.io.PrintStream@685d72cd
            This output indicates that System.out is a PrintStream, which is defined in a
            package called java.io. A package is a collection of related classes; java.io
            contains classes for I/O which stands for “input and output”.
            34 Chapter 3 Input and Output
            The numbers and letters after the @ sign are the address of System.out,
            represented as a hexadecimal (base 16) number. The address of a value is
            its location in the computer’s memory, which might be different on different
            computers. In this example, the address is 685d72cd, but if you run the same
            code, you will likely get something else.
            As shown in Figure 3.1, System is defined in a file called System.java, and
            PrintStream is defined in PrintStream.java. These files are part of the Java
            library, which is an extensive collection of classes that you can use in your
            programs. The source code for these classes is usually included with the com-
            piler (see Section 10.6).
            Figure 3.1: System.out.println refers to the out variable of the System
            class, which is a PrintStream that provides a method called println.<br><br>
            <h3>3.2 The Scanner Class</h3><br>
            The System class also provides the special value System.in, which is an
            InputStream that has methods for reading input from the keyboard. These
            methods are not convenient to use, but fortunately Java provides other classes
            that make it easy to handle common input tasks.
            For example, Scanner is a class that provides methods for inputting words,
            numbers, and other data. Scanner is provided by java.util, which is a
            package that contains various “utility classes”. Before you can use Scanner,
            you have to import it like this:
            3.2 The Scanner Class 35
            import java.util.Scanner;
            This import statement tells the compiler that when you refer to Scanner,
            you mean the one defined in java.util. Using an import statement is neces-
            sary because there might be another class named Scanner in another package.
            Next you have to initialize the Scanner. This line declares a Scanner variable
            named in and creates a Scanner that reads input from System.in:
            Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
            The Scanner class provides a method called nextLine that reads a line of
            input from the keyboard and returns a String. Here’s a complete example
            that reads two lines and repeats them back to the user:
            import java.util.Scanner;
            public class Echo {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
            String line;
            Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
            System.out.print("Type something: ");
            line = in.nextLine();
            System.out.println("You said: " + line);
            System.out.print("Type something else: ");
            line = in.nextLine();
            System.out.println("You also said: " + line);
            }
            }
            Import statements can’t be inside a class definition. By convention, they are
            usually at the beginning of the file. If you omit the import statement, you get
            a compiler error like “cannot find symbol”. That means the compiler doesn’t
            know where to find the definition for Scanner.
            You might wonder why we can use the System class without importing it.
            System belongs to the java.lang package, which is imported automatically.
