           <h2> Chapter 2
Variables and Operators</h2>
This chapter describes how to write statements using variables, which store
values like numbers and words, and operators, which are symbols that perform
a computation. We also explain three kinds of programming errors and offer
additional debugging advice.
To run the examples in this chapter, you will need to create a new Java class
with a main method (see Section 1.3). Throughout the book, we often omit
class and method definitions to keep the examples concise.<br><br>
<h3> Declaring Variables</h3>
One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to
define and manipulate variables. A variable is a named location in memory
that stores a value. Values may be numbers, text, images, sounds, and other
types of data. To store a value, you first have to declare a variable:
String message;
This statement is called a declaration, because it declares that the variable
message has the type String. Each variable has a type that determines what
kind of values it can store. For example, the int type can store integers like
1 and -5, and the char type can store characters like 'A' and 'z'.
18 Chapter 2 Variables and Operators
Some types begin with a capital letter and some with lowercase. You will learn
the significance of this distinction later, but for now you should take care to
get it right. There is no such type as Int or string.
To declare an integer variable named x, you simply type this:
int x;
Note that x is an arbitrary name for the variable. In general, you should use
names that indicate what the variables mean:
String firstName;
String lastName;
int hour, minute;
This example declares two variables with type String and two with type int.
The last line shows how to declare multiple variables with the same type: hour
and minute are both integers. Note that each declaration statement ends with
a semicolon (;).<br>
Variable names usually begin with a lowercase letter, in contrast to class names
(like Hello) that start with a capital letter. When a variable name con-
tains more than one word (like firstName), it is conventional to capitalize
the first letter of each subsequent word. Variable names are case-sensitive, so
firstName is not the same as firstname or FirstName.
You can use any name you want for a variable. But there are about 50 reserved
words, called keywords, that you are not allowed to use as variable names.
These words include public, class, static, void, and int, which are used
by the compiler to analyze the structure of the program.
You can see the full list of keywords (https://thinkjava.org/keywords),
but you don’t have to memorize them. Most programming editors provide
“syntax highlighting”, which makes different parts of the program appear in
different colors. And the compiler will complain even if one does sneak past
you and your editor.<br><br>
<h3>Assigning Variables</h3>
Now that we have declared some variables, we can use them to store values.
We do that with an assignment statement:
2.3 Memory Diagrams 19
message = "Hello!"; // give message the value "Hello!"
hour = 11; // assign the value 11 to hour
minute = 59; // set minute to 59
This example shows three assignments, and the comments illustrate different
ways people sometimes talk about assignment statements. The vocabulary
can be confusing here, but the idea is straightforward:
 When you declare a variable, you create a named storage location.
 When you make an assignment to a variable, you update its value.
As a general rule, a variable has to have the same type as the value you
assign to it. For example, you cannot store a string in minute or an integer in
message. We will show some examples that seem to break this rule, but we’ll
get to that later.<br>
A common source of confusion is that some strings look like integers, but they
are not. For example, message can contain the string "123", which is made
up of the characters '1', '2', and '3'. But that is not the same thing as the
integer 123:
message = "123"; // legal
message = 123; // not legal
Variables must be initialized (assigned for the first time) before they can
be used. You can declare a variable and then assign a value later, as in the
previous example. You can also declare and initialize on the same line:
String message = "Hello!";
int hour = 11;
int minute = 59;
